# GameOfTheAmazons - An AI version of the chess variant 'Game of the Amazons'. 

This was programmed for the [COSC 322](http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/okanagan/courses.cfm?code=COSC
) (Introduction to Artificial Intelligence) at the University of British Columbia. Unfortunately, it was run on a private game server (see AmazonGameClient.java) and the source code is not available.

#Approach Used
1. A tree structure was constructed in order to store possible states of the game for evaluation

2. For short term move optimization, a Minimax algorithm used in order to pick the best possible move. This is done by maximizing your best possible move, while minimizing the opponent's best move. Alpha-Beta pruning was also used in order to eliminte nodes that do not need to be evaluated due to their ranking from the heuristic value given by the Relative Territory Heuristic

3. For long term move optimzation, a Monte Carlo tree search was later added. 

4. Multiple cores were used, with one performing Minimax and three performing Monte Carlo

Frontier Expansion/Trimming to allow for better moves generated by Minimax, frontier expansion and trimming is performed to populate, or reduce the amount of game tree nodes present within the game tree.

Heuristic
The Relative Territory Heuristic was used as the heuristic function. This heuristic decides who owns a block on the game board by looking at which player can reach a square faster with a queen, and ignores the arrow shots while performing the search. The heuristic follows this structure:
For each block, B, on the gameboard, compare dist_black = dist(B, Black) and dist_white = dist(B, White) where Black represents the black colored game piece, and White represents the white colored game piece.
If dist_black is greater than dist_white, Black owns that block of the board
Else if, dist_white is greater than dist_black, White owns that block of the board
Else, the block is neutral
